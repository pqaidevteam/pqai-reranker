# PQAI Reranker

Service for (re)ranking documents.

Reranking is the process in which a relatively small number of (say a thousand)
documents are ranked in order of their relevance to a query. The small number of
documents are typically obtained by a coarse but fast searching technique from a
large corpus. Reranking techniques are more accurate in terms of relevance
judgement but not scalable for millions of documents.


For more detailed information, please refer to [PQAI Wiki](https://github.com/pqaidevteam/pqai/wiki/pqai-reranker).
